![[The Auror's Bounty.mp3]]

[Verse] 
The Auror sailed on a moonless black 
With sails of silk and a treasure-packed 
Gold enough to rule a king's domain 
Yet shadows whispered Calling her name 

[Prechorus] 
Through winds that howl 
Through waves that roar 
Her fate was sealed where none restore 

[Chorus] 
Stones that sing where the tide meets the shore 
They guard the wealth and the legends of yore 
Down in the deep where the shadows keep 
The Auror's bounty Lost in sleep 

[Verse 2] 
Men tell tales of the cursed ship's fall 
Of phantom hands and the ocean's thrall 
Her crew now wraiths 
Bound to the tide
Forever trapped where the secrets hide 

[Prechorus] 
The moonlight fades 
The sea turns still 
Her ghostly masts 
They haunt the chill 

[Chorus] 
Stones that sing where the tide meets the shore 
They guard the wealth and the legends of yore 
Down in the deep where the shadows keep 
The Auror's bounty Lost in sleep
