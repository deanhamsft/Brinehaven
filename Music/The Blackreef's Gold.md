![[The Blackreef's Gold.mp3]]
[Verse] 
Oh the waves they roar 
And the winds they bite 
The ship creaks loud in the dead of night 
Lanterns swing like drunken sprites
As the Blackreef calls us home 

[Chorus] 
Oh the waves they roar 
And the winds they bite 
But the Blackreef’s gold shines in the night 
A treasure cursed 
A sailor’s delight 
We’ll sail till the devil’s done 

[Verse 2] 
Shadows dance on the ocean’s face 
The moon keeps watch 
A ghostly grace 
Salt and sweat in a deadly race 
For the Blackreef’s golden throne 

[Prechorus] 
What price to pay 
What soul to lose 
When gold calls out your name 

[Chorus] 
Oh the waves they roar 
And the winds they bite 
But the Blackreef’s gold shines in the night 
A treasure cursed 
A sailor’s delight 
We’ll sail till the devil’s done 

[Bridge] 
Coins that glint like a siren’s eyes 
Promises made of blood and lies 
The tide it turns 
The captain cries 
No turning back It’s done
