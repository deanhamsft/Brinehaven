[[The Adventure begins]]
[[The Hearthstone Secret]]
[[The Wreck of the Auror's Bounty]]

**Morning sun burns through the thinning mist over Brinehaven’s stony coast, casting long shadows across the pebbled beach. The air is crisp, with a salty breeze carrying the scent of pine and seaweed, hinting at the day’s promise of clear weather—ideal for a coastal trek.**

**The party begins at the Brinehaven docks, where the previous night’s sahuagin attack left Lira stabilized and the rune-etched stone marker near the pier glowing faintly after the lightning strike. Ysmeine Tidecarver, still shaken but resolute, joins the group, clutching her bone flute. She shares her dream of a “golden ship guarded by fish with teeth” and suggests the markers might hold answers to the Auror’s Bounty’s location.**

Objective: Locate and activate the three coastal stone markers, each tied to the map fragment’s runes and Ysmeine’s flute. Success (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) per marker) Will direct the party back to the hearth in the tavern at Brinehaven

The Three Coastal Stone Markers

1. Dockside Marker (Already Discovered)

	- Location: Near the northern edge of the Brinehaven docks, 10 feet from the pier’s base (see ASCII map: ^ at top row).
	- Description: A 5-foot-tall weathered stone pillar, etched with faded elven runes that pulse faintly after last night’s lightning. Seaweed clings to its base, and pebbles are scattered around it.
	- Activation: A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check deciphers the runes, revealing a partial phrase: ==“The tide guards the first key.”== If successful, the marker glows, and Ysmeine’s flute hums, pointing north along the coast. Failure (by 5 or more) causes a minor shock (1d6 lightning damage, DC 12 Dexterity save for half).
	- Challenge: The area is still slick from last night’s storm (DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to move safely). A DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spots sahuagin tracks leading into the water, hinting at their interest.

2. Blackreef Cove Marker

	- Location: 2 miles north of Brinehaven, in a jagged inlet known as Blackreef Cove, surrounded by cliffs and jagged rocks.
	- Description: **A 6-foot-tall marker half-buried in the sand, its runes weathered but legible. The cove’s waters are turbulent, with driftwood and seaweed strewn about. A faint hum emanates from the stone, audible to those within 10 feet.**
	- Activation: DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) reveals the phrase: ==“The second key lies where the stones weep.”== Success causes the marker to emit a low chime, aligning with Ysmeine’s flute and pointing northwest. Failure summons a water elemental (CR 5, Monster Manual p. 125) for 1 minute, hostile unless calmed (DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)).
	- Challenge: The cliffs require a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to descend safely (50 ft drop, 5d6 bludgeoning damage on failure). A DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check finds a hidden path. Sahuagin (1d4, CR 1/2 each) patrol the water, alerted by the activation.

3. Stormwatch Point Marker

	- Location: 3 miles northwest of Brinehaven, atop a promontory overlooking the sea, near the ruins of an old logging, man camp.
	- Description: **An 8-foot-tall marker, its runes glowing faintly under the midday sun. The site is windswept, with a crumbling stone platform and a view of the horizon where storms brew. The lighthouse’s broken beacon lies nearby.**
	- Activation: DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) deciphers: ==“The third key unlocks the path to the last.”== Success projects a holographic image of the hearth at The Brinehaven Hearth.
	- Failure triggers a storm cloud (20-ft radius, 2d6 lightning damage per round, DC 13 Dexterity save, lasts 1 minute unless dispersed with magic).
	- Challenge: High winds impose disadvantage on ranged attacks and require a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to move. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a smuggler’s journal (links to Kael Draven’s camp) near the mancamp ruins.

Exploration Journey

Travel: The 3-mile trek takes 1 hour on foot along the coastal path (moderate pace, 4 miles/hour). The party can bring Ysmeine, who provides a +2 bonus on Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate. Random encounters (roll 1d6 per mile):

- 1-2: None.
- 3-4: Wild boar (CR 1/4, Monster Manual p. 319) foraging, hostile if provoked.
- 5-6: 1d3 sahuagin scouts (CR 1/2) watching from the water, retreating if outnumbered.

Environmental Hazards:

- Mist Remnants: Visibility drops to 40 ft in patches (DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) at disadvantage beyond this range).
- Rocky Terrain: DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to avoid slipping (1d4 bludgeoning damage on failure).
- Tide: Rising water at Blackreef Cove may flood the beach (DC 12 Strength (Athletics) to wade, or retreat).

Roleplay with Ysmeine: She shares her mother’s tales of elven sea rituals, suggesting the markers ward off a curse tied to the Auror’s Bounty. A DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check gains her trust, revealing the flute’s runes glow brighter near the wreck—potentially a key to access it.

The Sea Spirit Encounter

Trigger: Activating all three markers successfully (three DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks) triggers and encounter. A shimmering portal opens above the Stormwatch Point marker, and a sea spirit (use Water Elemental stats, CR 5, with neutral alignment) emerges, its form a swirling mass of water and mist with glowing eyes.

- Stats: AC 14, HP 114 (12d10+36), Speed 30 ft., swim 90 ft. Multiattack (slam x2), Whelm (grapple and drown, DC 15 Strength save). Immune to poison, exhaustion; resistant to fire.
- Behavior: The spirit is neutral, offering lore for a price. It knows the Auror’s Bounty’s location (100 yards offshore, 200 ft deep) and warns of a “guardian of the golden tide” (e.g., a kraken priest or cursed relic). Price options:
    - Blood Offering: 1 HP per party member (healing magic can’t restore until a long rest).
    - Item Sacrifice: A magical item (DM discretion on value, e.g., +1 weapon).
    - Promise: Aid the spirit in cleansing a sahuagin corruption (leads to a side quest).
- Negotiation: DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) reduces the price; failure (by 5 or more) turns it hostile for 1 minute.

Outcome: If the price is met, the spirit imparts a vision: the wreck lies 100 yards southeast of Blackreef Cove, guarded by a shadowy figure wielding a trident. It also hints the map fragment and flute are keys to bypass the guardian.

> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> - Difficulty: The journey suits a Level 3-5 party of six. The Arcana checks are the core challenge, with optional combat (sahuagin, elemental) for variety. Adjust marker distances or hazards for higher levels.
> - Pacing: The 1-hour trek and three activations (30 minutes each) fit a 2-3 hour session, leaving time for the spirit encounter or a follow-up dive.
> - Tie-Ins: The runes connect to the map fragment, Ysmeine’s heritage, and the sahuagin threat, deepening the Auror’s Bounty mystery. The spirit’s price can lead to moral choices or a new quest.
> - Scaling:
>     - Level 1-2: Reduce to two markers, no elemental (sahuagin in pairs).
>     - Level 6+: Add a Sahuagin Baron (CR 5) guarding the third marker, with the spirit offering a greater reward (e.g., Pearl of Power).
