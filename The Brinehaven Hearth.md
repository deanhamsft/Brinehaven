[[The Adventure begins]]
[[Aerdrie Faenya]] Patron Deity of Brinehaven

**The Brinehaven Hearth is a two-story structure, its exterior clad in weathered planks adorned with shells and driftwood carvings. A sign above the door, painted with a bird of paradise with outstretched wings above a stylized hearth wreathed in seaweed, swings gently in the coastal breeze. Inside, the tavern is a cozy haven: a large  fireplace built around a rune-carved stone  dominates the common room, its crackling flames casting a warm glow over sturdy wooden tables and benches worn smooth by generations of patrons. Nets, lanterns, and old harpoons hang from the rafters, while the faint scent of smoked fish and ale mingles with the salty air. A small stage in one corner hosts occasional performances by local bards or sailors with a knack for storytelling.**

**The tavern’s upper floor contains three large common 'flop' rooms, often occupied by sailors or rare travelers seeking respite. A narrow staircase behind the bar leads to the proprietors’ private quarters. The cellar, carved into the rocky earth, stores barrels of ale, salted fish, and a stash of aged rum traded from distant ports.**

**The Brinehaven Hearth is a lively yet intimate place, filled with the hum of conversation, the clink of tankards, and the occasional burst of laughter or sea shanty. The tavern attracts a mix of villagers—human fishers, half-elf net-weavers, and grizzled elders—alongside young sailors who crew the small fishing boats or trade vessels that brave the stony coast. These sailors, often in their teens or early twenties, find a second home here, drawn by the tavern’s warmth and the kindness of its proprietors. On stormy nights, the Hearth becomes a refuge, its doors open to anyone seeking shelter from the howling winds and crashing waves.**

**You adventurers push open the heavy oak door of the Brinehaven Hearth, greeted by a wave of warmth from the massive stone fireplace at the room’s heart. The tavern is quiet in the early afternoon, with only a handful of patrons: a grizzled fisherman nursing an ale, a half-elf woman weaving a net in the corner, and A broad-shouldered man with a weathered face, salt-and-pepper beard, polishing tankards behind the bar. The scent of fish stew wafts from the kitchen, mingling with the faint tang of salt air. Sunlight streams through salt-fogged windows, illuminating motes of dust and the driftwood carvings hanging from the rafters.**

[[Calen Shorewhistle]]

**A half-elf bard, is tuning his lute by the hearth, his fingers pausing as he glances at the newcomers with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

[[Ysmeine Tidecarver]]

**A bone flute rests on a table, its runes catching the light.
 
**The  broad-shouldered man looks up, his weathered face, eye's growing wide, he manages to break into a broad, but shocked grin. “W-W-W-Well, now! Strangers in Brinehaven—haven’t seen a crew like you in a spell. Come for the stew or the sea’s secrets?” His tone is warm but probing, his eyes sharp as he sizes up the group. A woman emerges from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron, she hesitates for a heartbeat then offers a motherly smile. “Don’t mind Torren’s chatter. Sit, rest your legs. You look like you’ve sailed through a squall to get here. I'll take good care of you lot dearies. Name's Mirra, Mirra Gale”.

#### Several unoccupied tables lie ahead of you.

**Torren Gale**

**Torren is eager to hear the party’s story, offering a round of Fisher’s Ale (5 cp each, on the house if they share their tale).** If they mention the shipwreck or the map fragment, his eyes narrow thoughtfully. “Auror’s Bounty, you say? Old tale, that one. Folks here whisper of a galleon lost in a storm, gold spilling into the deep. But the coast’s a cruel mistress—those rocks’ll tear a ship to splinters.” He points to the corkboard, mentioning a sailor’s sketch of a wreck seen off Blackreef Cove, a jagged inlet a day’s trek north. He warns them of strange lights seen there at night, hinting at “sea spirits or worse.”

**Roleplay Opportunity:**

**Torren loves a good story and might trade information for one.** 
A successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces him to share a rumor: a local elder claims the Auror’s Bounty carried a cursed relic that angered the sea. If pressed (DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion)), he admits a cloaked stranger passed through last month, asking about old runes on the coast’s stone markers.

**Mirra Gale**

**Mirra is warmer but more cautious.**
If they show her the map fragment, she frowns, recognizing the script as similar to runes on her mother’s old recipes. “Those marks look like the ones on our hearthstone,” she says softly, gesturing to the fireplace’s massive, rune-etched stone. She urges the party to rest and eat (fish stew, 3 sp), warning them that Blackreef Cove is dangerous, especially with recent storms. If a party member seems troubled or young, she offers a kind word, perhaps reminding them of home.

**Roleplay Opportunity:** 
A DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals Mirra’s worry isn’t just for the party but for the village—she fears their quest might stir up old troubles. If the party gains her trust (DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) or a heartfelt roleplay moment), she shares that her mother, a half-elf, once spoke of a “golden tide” that would bring ruin if disturbed.

**Calen Shorewhistle**

Calen, lounging by the hearth, upon overhearing any mention of the Auror’s Bounty and saunters over, lute in hand. “Treasure, eh? I’ve sung of that wreck—gold enough to buy an empire, they say, but guarded by shadows in the deep.” He offers to share his song for a few coppers (or free if the party buys him a drink). His lyrics mention “stones that sing where the tide meets the shore,” possibly a clue to the map’s “Brinehaven’s stones.”

If pressed, he admits he heard the tale from a smuggler who claimed to have seen the wreck’s mast at a rare low tide.

[[The Aurors Bounty]]

**Roleplay Opportunity:**
Calen is a charmer but slippery. A DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check gets him to reveal the smuggler’s name—Retch, a half-elf rogue who’s been scarce lately. Alternatively, Calen might offer to join the party to Blackreef Cove for a share of the loot, using his Bardic Inspiration to aid them but keeping his own agenda close to his chest.

  
> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes:
> 
> This scene sets the stage for a classic D&D treasure-hunting adventure, with the Brinehaven Hearth as a hub for roleplay and information-gathering. The six adventurers, unfamiliar with each other, can bond through shared interactions with the NPCs, establishing group dynamics before heading into danger. 
> 
> - Levels 1–3: The Blackreef Cove investigation involves environmental challenges (storms, slippery cliffs) and a fight against low-CR foes like sahuagin (CR 1/2) or a giant crab (CR 1/8).
> - Levels 4–6: Add a supernatural element, like a ghost of the Auror’s Bounty’s captain (use the Ghost stat block, CR 4) or a young sea serpent (CR 5, reskinned giant crocodile) guarding the wreck.
> - Social Challenges: Use skill checks to navigate village suspicion (e.g., DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) to gain locals’ trust) or uncover clues (e.g., DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to decipher the map fragment’s runes).

# The Proprietors

[[Ysmeine Tidecarver]]

> [!WARNING] A perception check (8) the party will notice the runes of the bone flute glowing during a performance. 
> She confides in the party that she’s dreamt of her mother warning her about a “storm beneath the waves.” The party could investigate the flute’s origins, leading to an ancient elven shrine in the forest or a submerged ruin off the coast.
