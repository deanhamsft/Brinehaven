[[The Brinehaven Hearth]]
[[The Adventure begins]] 
[[The Rune Stones]]
[[Seaside Monsters]]

**The Night Turns Dark, the sky outside cloaked in a thick, rolling mist that muffles the distant crash of waves against Brinehaven’s stony coast. The air is heavy with the promise of a storm, and the tavern’s windows rattle faintly in the rising wind.**

**Inside the Brinehaven Hearth, the atmosphere has grown lively as the night deepens. The six adventurers, still strangers bound by the lure of the Auror’s Bounty treasure map, huddle at a corner table, their voices low as they pore over the cryptic parchment fragment and share what they’ve gleaned from the tavern’s patrons.**

**Calen Shorewhistle strums a soft, mournful tune on his lute, weaving tales of lost ships, while Ysmeine Tidecarver’s flute hums a haunting counterpoint. The hearth’s fire casts flickering shadows across the room, where a dozen locals—fishermen, half-elf net-weavers, and young sailors—sip ale and swap stories. Mirra Gale moves between tables, refilling tankards with a warm smile, though her eyes occasionally dart to the windows, uneasy about the gathering storm. Torren, usually a fixture behind the bar, is absent—perhaps in the cellar fetching more ale or checking the tavern’s storm shutters.**

**The party’s conversation—perhaps debating Torren’s tale of strange lights at Blackreef Cove or Mirra’s cryptic hint about the hearthstone’s runes—pauses as a blinding flash of lightning illuminates the tavern’s windows. The bolt strikes so close that the air crackles with static, and a deafening crack of thunder shakes the walls, silencing Calen and Ysmeine mid-note. Tankards clatter, and a fisherman spills his ale. Before anyone can react, a shrill, blood-curdling scream pierces the night, echoing from the direction of the docks. It’s a woman’s voice, raw with terror, fading into the misty darkness.**

**The tavern falls deathly silent. Calen’s lute dangles from his hand, his roguish grin gone, eyes wide with alarm. Ysmeine clutches her flute, her knuckles white, her gaze fixed on the door as if expecting something monstrous to burst through. Mirra freezes near the hearth, a tray of crab cakes slipping from her hands to clatter on the floor. Her face is pale, her motherly warmth replaced by shock and anxiety. “That was Lira,” she whispers, naming a young half-elf sailor who frequents the tavern. “She was headed to the docks to check her boat…” The locals exchange fearful glances, some murmuring about “sea devils” or “the curse of the Auror.” Torren is still nowhere to be seen, leaving the party as the most capable-looking figures in the room. All eyes turn toward the heavy oak door, the receding echo of the scream hanging in the air like a specter.**

NPC Reactions

**Calen Shorewhistle**

**Calen’s usual bravado falters, but he recovers quickly, slinging his lute over his shoulder. “That scream’s no gull’s cry. Something’s prowling out there—seen it before, when the seas turn angry.”**

> [!WARNING]
> If the party asks for his help, he hesitates, muttering about “bad omens,” but a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check convinces him to join them to the docks, offering Bardic Inspiration (d6) to one party member. He knows the docks well and can guide the party through the mist (granting advantage on navigation checks). If questioned about the Auror’s Bounty, he whispers, “Retch, that smuggler I mentioned? He said the wreck’s stirred something in the deep. Maybe it’s not just gold down there.”

Roleplay Opportunity: If the party searches Calen’s belongings (DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)), they find a scrap of parchment with a sketch of a sahuagin claw, suggesting he knows more about the threat than he’s letting on.

**Mirra Gale**

**Mirra’s shock quickly turns to action, though her hands tremble. She steps toward the party, her voice urgent but steady. “Please, you look like you’ve seen trouble before. Lira’s one of ours—she doesn’t scream for nothing. Something’s wrong at the docks.”**

 If the party hesitates, she adds,

**“I’d go myself, but I’ve got to keep this lot calm. Find her, please.” Her eyes glisten with worry.**

> [!WARNING] A DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check 
> On success: reveals she’s not just concerned for Lira but fears this attack is tied to the old tales of the Auror’s Bounty. If asked about Torren, she says, “He’s in the cellar, securing the barrels—storm’s got him worried. I’ll fetch him.”

> [!WARNING]
> A DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check 
> On success convinces Mirra to share a protective charm—a small seashell pendant etched with a rune (grants +1 to AC for 1 hour, one use)—to aid the party. If they mention the shipwreck, she warns, “The Auror’s gold brings nothing but trouble. Be careful what you chase.”

**Ysmeine Tidecarver**

**Ysmeine’s petrified expression softens into resolve as she grips her flute. “Lira’s my friend,” she says quietly. “If you’re going to the docks, I’m coming.” She’s not a fighter but offers to play her flute to calm nerves** 
(granting advantage on saves against fear for 10 minutes to creatures within 30 feet). Her knowledge of the coast gives the party a +2 bonus on Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate the rocky shore. 

> [!NOTE]
> If the party mentions the map fragment, she gasps, recognizing its runes as matching her flute’s. “My mother said these were tied to the sea’s wrath…”

> [!WARNING]
> A DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check 
> On success gets Ysmeine to share a dream she had of a “golden ship guarded by fish with teeth.” She’s reluctant to join a fight but can be convinced to stay close, potentially revealing more about her flute’s connection to the shipwreck.

Torren Gale (Absent)
**Torren’s absence adds tension—locals mutter he’s likely in the cellar or checking the tavern’s storm shutters.**

> [!NOTE]
> If the party seeks him out (requiring a minute to find him in the cellar), he’s hauling barrels, unaware of the scream. “Storm’s got the sea riled up,” he grumbles. “Heard tales of fish-folk when the waves turn mean.”

He won’t join the party but offers a rusty harpoon (treat as a spear with a +1 to hit against aquatic creatures) if they’re heading to the docks.

[[The Docks]]

> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> This encounter escalates the tension in Brinehaven, tying the sahuagin attack to the Auror’s Bounty mystery while giving the party a chance to shine as heroes. The fight is balanced for a level 1–3 party of six, with one or two sahuagin providing a manageable threat (adjust to three for a level 4 party). The misty, slippery docks add tactical depth, encouraging creative use of spells or abilities (e.g., Fog Cloud to counter the mist or Rope Trick to secure Lira). The rune-etched dagger links the attack to the treasure map, keeping the party focused on their quest while introducing a new threat.
> 
> - Scaling the Encounter:
> 
> - Level 1–2: One sahuagin, with Lira at 0 HP (needs stabilization). Add a giant crab (CR 1/8) for variety.
> - Level 3–4: Two sahuagin, with a third arriving if the fight lasts 3 rounds. Add a shark (CR 1/2) in the water.
> - Level 5+: Include a sahuagin baron (CR 5) watching from the water, retreating if the sahuagin fall, setting up a future boss fight.
> 
> - Roleplay Focus: If the party prefers investigation over combat, they can question Lira or search the docks for clues (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) finds sahuagin tracks leading to a submerged cave). Calen or Ysmeine can provide lore, tying the attack to village legends.
