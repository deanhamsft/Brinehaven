- Pantheon: Forgotten Realms (Elven Pantheon)
- Alignment: Chaotic Good
- Domains: Air, Nature, Tempest
- Symbol: Bird of paradise with outstretched wings
- Description: Aerdrie Faenya, the elven goddess of air, weather, and birds, is an ideal patron for Brinehaven. As a deity revered by elves and half-elves, she fits the village’s mixed heritage and its forested, coastal environment. Her association with weather ties to the stormy seas that shaped Brinehaven’s history, including the Auror’s Bounty’s sinking, while her protective nature aligns with the elven ward anchored by the hearthstone. Her chaotic good alignment reflects the village’s self-reliant, tight-knit community, which values freedom and resilience against threats like sahuagin.

Why Aerdrie Faenya Fits Brinehaven

1. Cultural Blend: With 10% half-elves and a 1,000-year history tied to elven founders, Aerdrie’s elven roots resonate with the village’s origins. Human fishers might honor her as a weather goddess, blending traditions.
2. Maritime Connection: Her dominion over air and weather suits a coastal village dependent on fishing and vulnerable to storms, mirroring the recent tempest on October 08, 2025.
3. Protective Ward: The hearthstone and markers’ elven magic align with Aerdrie’s protective aspect, suggesting her followers established the ward to guard against sea threats, now weakened by the Auror’s Bounty’s curse.
4. Narrative Tie-In: Aerdrie’s influence could explain the glowing runes and the Marid’s appearance, hinting that restoring her favor (e.g., returning the pearl) might strengthen the ward against sahuagin and Carival Stanislain’s cult.

Worship and Practices

- Shrines: Small shrines with bird motifs (e.g., carved wooden avians) are scattered along the coast, including near the Stormwatch Point marker. The hearthstone itself may serve as a communal altar.
- Rituals: Villagers perform dawn chants to calm the sea, using flutes (like Ysmeine’s) or shanties (like Calen’s) to honor Aerdrie. The annual Storm Festival (mentioned earlier) likely celebrates her, now disrupted by the curse.
- Clergy: A few half-elf priests (Level 1-3 Clerics of Tempest or Nature) lead services, with Mirra Gale’s family historically maintaining the ward, tying to Ysmeine’s heritage.
- Offerings: Feathers, seashells, and fish are left at shrines, with a special offering of a silver bird figurine (10 gp) during storms.

Campaign Integration

- The Auror’s Bounty: The pearl’s theft from an elven shrine angered Aerdrie, cursing the ship and weakening her ward. Returning it could earn her blessing (e.g., Commune spell access for the party).
- Rune Connection: The markers’ runes may bear Aerdrie’s symbol, requiring her invocation to activate fully. Ysmeine’s flute could be a sacred instrument, amplifying the ritual.
- Hearthstone’s Secret: The hearthstone’s glow signals Aerdrie’s waning protection, with a ritual (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)) to restore it, possibly summoning an air elemental (CR 5) as her avatar.
- Carival and Valthor: Carival’s cult opposes Aerdrie, seeking the pearl to empower Valthor’s kraken ritual. Defeating them could align the party with her favor.
- Sahuagin Threat: As sea devils, sahuagin defy Aerdrie’s domain, explaining their aggression. Her priests might aid the party against them.

Adventure Hook

- Aerdrie’s Test: A priest (e.g., Level 3 Cleric) asks the party to retrieve a stolen bird relic from Kael’s camp, promising a Feather Token (anchor type) if successful. This draws them into the smuggler-sahuagin conflict.

DM Notes

- Level Range: Aerdrie’s influence suits a Level 3-5 party, with elemental or priest encounters. Scale with sahuagin (CR 1/2) or cultists (CR 1/8) for variety.
- Flavor: Her bird motifs and weather themes enhance Brinehaven’s atmosphere, especially during the current storm (October 12, 2025, 03:09 PM MDT).
- Reward: Restoring her favor could grant a Wind Walk spell or a +1 bonus to saving throws against storm effects for 24 hours.
