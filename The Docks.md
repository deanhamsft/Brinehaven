[[Party hears attack at the Docks]]

**The Sahuagin Attack**

**The party rushes to the docks through the misty night, guided by the faint glow of lanterns along the pier, they find the scene of the attack. The mist reduces visibility to 30 feet, and the ground is slick with seawater**

> [!WARNING] (DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid slipping when moving more than half speed).

**Lira, a young half-elf sailor, lies slumped against a piling, bloodied but alive, her arm gashed by claws.**

**The docks reveal themselves before you, under a swirling, misty sky, the sea a dark, churning expanse broken by jagged rocks. The pier juts out like a weathered finger, its planks creaking underfoot, stained with salt and fish guts. Lantern light flickers at its end, casting eerie shadows on the pilings where Lira lies slumped, her blood pooling on the wood. The pebbled beach glitters faintly with wet stones.**

**An ancient rune-carved marker standing sentinel at its head, half-hidden by mist. The forest looms to the north, its pines swaying in the wind, whispering secrets of Brinehaven’s ancient past. The water laps hungrily at the pier.**

> [!WARNING] (perception; DC 8) party member sees a sahuagin’s glinting eyes as he watches his prey.

  
> [!WARNING] (Perception; DC 12) A second sahuagin lurks 20 feet out, emerging if combat begins. The sahuagin aim to drag Lira into the sea (grapple, DC 12 Strength or Dexterity to resist) unless stopped.

**Combat Flow:**

- Round 1: The first sahuagin attacks Lira or the nearest PC, prioritizing grapple. The second sahuagin emerges, targeting a PC with a spear throw (range 20/60 ft.).
- Round 2: If Lira is grappled, the sahuagin dives, dragging her underwater (she begins suffocating unless freed). A wave might crash (see Hazards).
- Round 3+: If the fight continues, 1d4 sahuagin arrive, escalating the threat. One may flee to summon reinforcements if reduced to 5 HP or fewer.

- Lira’s Fate: A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check or any healing magic stabilizes Lira. If saved, she warns, ==“Fish-men… said the gold calls them!”== She can be escorted to the tavern.

Loot: 
	The sahuagin carry coral necklaces (5 gp each), a tarnished silver ring (15 gp) stolen from Lira, and a bone dagger with a rune matching the Auror’s Bounty map fragment (nonmagical but a plot clue). A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check on the dagger suggests it’s part of a set used in a ritual tied to the wreck.

NPC Support:

- Calen Shorewhistle: If convinced (DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)), he joins, using Bardic Inspiration (d6) and casting Charm Person or Cure Wounds (1st level). He knows the docks, granting advantage on navigation checks.
- Ysmeine Tidecarver: If present, she plays her flute to grant advantage on saves against fear (30-foot radius, 10 minutes). She stays out of melee but can stabilize Lira if the party protects her.

  
Tactical Considerations

- Party Strategy: The narrow pier forces melee PCs into close quarters, while ranged PCs can use the beach’s rocks or crates for cover. Spells like Fog Cloud or Entangle can control the battlefield, but the mist and current complicate targeting. Healing Lira early prevents her death, earning the party goodwill in Brinehaven.
- Sahuagin Tactics: They use hit-and-run attacks, diving to avoid counterattacks and targeting weakened PCs (Blood Frenzy). If Lira is secured, they focus on the strongest-looking PC to disrupt the group.
- Environmental Play: PCs can topple crates for area denial, cut the rope coil to improvise a trap, or lure sahuagin onto the beach to negate their swim speed. The stone marker might be activated mid-combat (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)) to emit a pulse that frightens aquatic creatures (DC 13 Wisdom save or frightened for 1 minute).


> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> This map and encounter are designed for a level 1–3 party of six, with the sahuagin providing a moderate threat balanced by the terrain’s challenges. The mist, slick surfaces, and current add tactical depth, encouraging creative solutions (e.g., using the rope to lasso a sahuagin or toppling crates to block the pier). The stone marker and dagger tie the encounter to the Auror’s Bounty plot, keeping the treasure hunt central while introducing the sahuagin as a recurring threat.
