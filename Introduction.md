**Nestled in ancient forests sits the windswept village of Brinehaven, where dense coastal forests meet a rugged, stony shoreline a remote settlement far from the bustle of larger towns.**

**Brinehaven, founded over 1,000 years ago, is a large human village of some 2,000 souls, with a notable minority of half-elves (roughly 10%) who trace their lineage to unions between human fishers and elven wanderers who once roamed the coastal woods.**

**The village’s isolation, surrounded by dense pine and cedar forests and cut off from major trade routes, has fostered a tight-knit community that values self-reliance and tradition. The stony coast, with its jagged cliffs and pebbled beaches, provides ample fishing grounds, though treacherous currents and sudden storms keep the villagers vigilant. Ancient stone markers, etched with faded runes from Brinehaven’s founding, dot the coastline, hinting at a storied past tied to the sea and perhaps forgotten magic.**

**The village sustains itself through fishing, small-scale logging, and trade with passing ships, though its remoteness means visitors are rare. The half-elf population often serves as mediators, their longer lifespans and innate charisma making them natural leaders in village councils. Despite its age, Brinehaven remains rustic, with stone-and-timber homes clustered around a central square where the Brinehaven Hearth stands proudly.**
