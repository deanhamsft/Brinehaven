Player Micaela

Maria found a locked cittern case at a second hand store in the city of Malkan. The case is locked and must be magically unlocked using a 3rd level Dispel Magic or Knock. 

Attempting to pick the lock requires a CR 25 to unlock, failure results in 1d4 psychic damage. 

The item cannot be attended to or used until 3rd level.

_Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement by a Bard)_

An _Instrument of the Bards_ is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. The Instruments of the Bards table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 Psychic damage.

You can play the instrument to cast one of its spells. **Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn**. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
