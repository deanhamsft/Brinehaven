- Full Name: Ysmeine Tidecarver
- Race: Human
- Age: 27
- Occupation: Flutist, Fisher’s Daughter, Amateur Seer
- History: Ysmeine was born and raised in Brinehaven, the daughter of a human fisherman and a half-elven woman who brought the family a bone flute etched with ancient runes. Her mother, a weaver of nets and dreams, taught her to play the flute, claiming it held the “voice of the sea.” After her mother’s death five years ago, Ysmeine took up performing at the Hearth, her melodies calming sailors and hinting at prophetic visions. The flute’s recent glowing runes, tied to her dreams of a “golden ship guarded by fish with teeth,” connect her to the Auror’s Bounty wreck. Her bond with Lira, attacked by sahuagin, drives her to aid the party, while her heritage links her to the elven ward anchored by the hearthstone and coastal markers.

Personality

- Traits: Gentle, introspective, and resilient. Ysmeine’s quiet demeanor hides a fierce loyalty to her village and friends, expressed through her music.
- Ideal: Harmony with the sea—Ysmeine believes music can heal the curse plaguing Brinehaven.
- Bond: Her bone flute, a heirloom from her mother, glows brighter near magical sites and is her source of strength.
- Flaw: Her shyness makes her hesitant to lead, relying on others to take charge in danger.

Role in Brinehaven

- Base: Ysmeine splits time between the Hearth, where she performs, and her father’s fishing hut near the docks. At 08:17 PM MDT, she’s at the Hearth, tending to Lira (stabilized after the sahuagin attack) as the storm rages outside.
- Reputation: Adored by young sailors as a big sister figure, her music is a village comfort. Mirra Gale often invites her to help in the kitchen, reinforcing her nurturing role.
- Current Focus: Her visions and the flute’s glow tie her to the Auror’s Bounty curse. She’s eager to help the party, seeing it as a way to honor her mother and protect Brinehaven.

Campaign Ties

- The Auror’s Bounty: Ysmeine’s dreams of the wreck and guardian (the ghost captain) suggest her flute is a ritual key. Removing the cursed pearl requires its music to dispel the ward.
- Rune Connection: The flute’s runes match the coastal markers and hearthstone, amplifying their activation. Her performance can grant advantage on DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks.
- Hearthstone’s Secret: Her mother’s tales link the hearthstone to an elven ward, and Ysmeine’s flute may unlock its full power, potentially summoning the Marid or revealing the wreck’s map.
- Carival Stanislain: She senses a “dark presence” (Carival) in her visions, warning the party of his greed. Her flute’s glow near him could expose his disguise.
- Smugglers and Sahuagin: Her friendship with Lira makes her a target for Kael’s crew, who fear her knowledge. The sahuagin priestess seeks the flute, believing it controls the pearl.

Interaction with the Party

- Encounter: the party finds Ysmeine in the Hearth’s corner, playing a soft tune to calm Lira. The storm’s thunder contrasts her melody, and she looks up with hope.
- Dialogue Options:
    - Persuasion (DC 12 Charisma): Ask for her aid with the flute. Success gains her support and the Soothing Melody; failure requires proving their intent (e.g., saving Lira again).
    - Insight (DC 13 Wisdom): Probe her visions. Success reveals the guardian’s trident; failure needs a Performance check to earn trust.
    - Intimidation (DC 15 Charisma): Demand the flute. Success yields it temporarily; failure makes her flee to Mirra.
- Quest Offer: She asks the party to retrieve a net her father lost near Blackreef Cove (10 gp reward), where she suspects a marker or sahuagin lair.
- Combat: Unlikely, but if attacked, she uses Soothing Melody and flees, seeking Torren’s protection. Her 9 HP suits a non-combat role for a Level 3-5 party.

The Blackreef Cove Net Quest

- Location: 1 mile north of Brinehaven, near the cove’s tide pools.
- Description: A submerged net (DC 12 Strength (Athletics) to retrieve) lies 10 ft deep, guarded by 1 giant crab (CR 1/8) and 1 sahuagin scout (CR 1/2).
- Challenge: DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) spots a second marker rune on a nearby rock, glowing faintly.
- Reward: The net (worth 5 gp) and a clue: the rune points to the wreck’s guardian ritual.

Adventure Hooks

1. Flute Ritual: Ysmeine’s music at the hearthstone could dispel the pearl’s curse, drawing Carival’s cultists (2 Cult Fanatics, CR 2) to stop her.
2. Sahuagin Hunt: The priestess targets Ysmeine, sending 3 sahuagin to the Hearth tonight, testing the party’s defense.
3. Mother’s Shrine: Her visions lead to a forest cave (1 mile north) with her mother’s journal, revealing the flute’s origin and a ward-sealing chant.
4. Kael’s Threat: Kael, learning of her flute, sends Mira "Swiftfoot" (Level 2 Rogue) to kidnap her, intersecting the party.
