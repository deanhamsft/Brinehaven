Calen "Drift" Shorewhistle

Background

- Full Name: Calen Shorewhistle
- Race: Half-Elf
- Age: 34
- Occupation: Wandering Bard, Part-Time Smuggler
- History: Calen was born to a human sailor and an elven minstrel who roamed the northern coasts, inheriting his mother’s musical talent and his father’s restless spirit. Raised on tales of shipwrecks and hidden treasures, he honed his lute skills in taverns across the region. His “Drift” nickname comes from his habit of moving between ports, avoiding trouble—until a botched smuggling job in a distant city forced him to flee to Brinehaven. There, he joined the Brinehaven Hearth’s nightly performances but secretly works with Kael Draven’s smugglers, trading songs for intel. His knowledge of the Auror’s Bounty wreck stems from a smuggler’s tale, and he carries a hidden map scrap linking it to the hearthstone’s runes, hinting at a deeper involvement.

Personality

- Traits: Charismatic, roguish, and opportunistic. Calen’s quick wit and charm mask a cautious nature, always ready with a jest or a shanty to deflect suspicion.
- Ideal: Freedom through fortune—Calen dreams of using the wreck’s treasure to escape his smuggling ties and live as a true bard.
- Bond: His weathered lute, carved with wave patterns by his mother, is his most treasured possession and a source of inspiration.
- Flaw: His dual life as a bard and smuggler creates conflicts of loyalty, especially if pressured by the party or Kael.

Role in Brinehaven

- Base: A regular performer at the Brinehaven Hearth, Calen entertains with sea shanties and ballads, often dedicating songs to Mirra Gale, whom he views as a maternal figure. At 08:14 PM MDT, he’s inside the Hearth, tuning his lute by the hearthstone as the storm rages outside.
- Reputation: Loved by sailors for his music but suspected by some locals of shady dealings, thanks to his late-night absences. His charm keeps him in good standing with Torren and Mirra.
- Current Focus: Calen’s recent song, “The Ghost of Blackreef Cove,” hints at the Auror’s Bounty’s location. He’s torn between aiding the party (for a share of the treasure) and protecting his smuggler ties.

Campaign Ties

- The Auror’s Bounty: Calen’s map scrap, obtained from Retch, shows a partial wreck layout and a ritual circle matching the hearthstone’s runes. He knows the pearl’s curse attracts sahuagin but keeps this secret unless pressured.
- Rune Connection: He’s overheard Lirien’s theories about the markers and suspects their activation could unlock the wreck, offering to guide the party (DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) to convince him).
- Hearthstone’s Secret: Calen noticed the hearthstone’s glow during the storm, linking it to his map. He can perform a shanty to aid the ritual (advantage on DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks if sung).
- Carival Stanislain: Calen met Carival during a smuggler deal, describing him as “a hooded snake.” He’s wary of Carival’s plans to claim the pearl, seeing a chance to double-cross him.
- Smugglers and Sahuagin: As Kael’s informant, Calen relays tavern gossip to the camp but fears the sahuagin priestess’s growing influence. His map scrap suggests Kael seeks the pearl for Carival.

Interaction with the Party

- Encounter: At 08:14 PM MDT, the party finds Calen in the Hearth, strumming a storm-lullaby as lightning flashes outside. He’s curious about their wreck dive, offering a sly grin.
- Dialogue Options:
    - Persuasion (DC 13 Charisma): Promise a treasure share. Success gains his map scrap and guidance; failure requires a performance duel (DC 14 Charisma (Performance)).
    - Intimidation (DC 15 Charisma): Threaten to expose his smuggling. Success yields the priestess’s tribute details; failure makes him hostile.
    - Deception (DC 14 Charisma): Pretend to work for Kael. Success unlocks his smuggler contacts; failure alerts Kael via a signal.
- Quest Offer: He suggests scouting Kael’s camp (5 miles north) for the priestess’s plans, offering 30 gp and a Potion of Healing as reward.
- Combat: If cornered, Calen casts Invisibility and flees, using Bardic Inspiration to boost his Stealth (+7). His 21 HP suits a Level 3-5 party skirmish.

The Smuggler Camp Scout

- Location: 5 miles north of Brinehaven, in the smugglers’ cove.
- Description: A hidden camp with a fire pit, lean-tos, and a cave. At night, 6-7 members (e.g., Veyra, Roric) are present, plus 2 guard dogs.
- Challenge: DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) to avoid detection. A DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) finds a sahuagin tribute crate (coral, 20 gp) and a note from the priestess.
- Reward: The note reveals a ritual to summon the pearl’s guardian, linking to Carival’s plans.

Adventure Hooks

1. Double-Cross Carival: Calen proposes betraying Carival, leading to an ambush at Blackreef Cove (Carival with 2 cultists, CR 1/8).
2. Sahuagin Pact: The tribute crate hints at a priestess meeting tomorrow, drawing the party into a negotiation or fight (4 sahuagin).
3. Kael’s Retribution: If Calen aids the party, Kael sends 3 Level 2 smugglers to silence him, intersecting the Hearth.
4. Lute’s Secret: The lute’s wave carvings glow near the hearthstone, suggesting a hidden song to dispel the pearl’s curse (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)).
