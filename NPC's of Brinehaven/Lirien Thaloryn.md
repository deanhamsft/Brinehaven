[[The Brinehaven Hearth]]
The Half-Elf Chronicler

Description

**A slender female Half-Elf Approaches the party cautiously. She Carries a leather journal as she steps up to the table wearing an expression of curiosity. She asks the party about their journey, probing for stories.**

Background

- Full Name: Lirien Thaloryn
- Race: Half-Elf
- Age: 72 (appears mid-30s due to elven longevity)
- Occupation: Chronicler, Amateur Archaeologist
- History: Lirien was born in Brinehaven to a human fisherman and an elven wanderer who settled in the village 100 years ago. Raised on tales of the village’s 1,000-year history, she developed a passion for preserving its lore, learning to read ancient elven scripts from her mother. Now a respected figure among the half-elf population, Lirien spends her days scouring the coast and forest for artifacts, recording stories in a leather-bound journal. Her recent interest in the Auror’s Bounty wreck stems from a fragment of elven poetry she found, hinting at a lost shrine tied to the ship’s curse. She’s aware of the hearthstone’s glow and the coastal markers’ runes, suspecting a connection to the wreck’s guardian.

Personality

- Traits: Curious, meticulous, and slightly eccentric. Lirien is warm to those who share her love of history but can be overly persistent when seeking knowledge.
- Ideal: Preservation of knowledge—Lirien believes Brinehaven’s past holds the key to its future.
- Bond: Her journal, a gift from her mother, contains decades of research and personal memories.
- Flaw: Overconfidence in her deductions, sometimes leading her to underestimate dangers like sahuagin or smugglers.

Role in Brinehaven

- Base: Lirien frequents the Brinehaven Hearth, where she records sailors’ tales and debates history with Torren Gale. At 08:02 PM MDT, she’s likely inside, sheltered from the storm, scribbling notes by the hearthstone.
- Reputation: Known as the village’s unofficial historian, she’s a resource for the party, offering quests to verify legends (e.g., lost ruins, sunken ships).
- Current Focus: She’s compiling a history of the Auror’s Bounty, suspecting its sinking ties to an elven shrine in the forest. Her research mentions the hearthstone and markers as part of a ward, aligning with the party’s findings.

Campaign Ties

- The Auror’s Bounty: Lirien’s poetry fragment suggests the cursed pearl was stolen from the shrine, weakening the ward. She can guide the party to the wreck’s location if they share the map fragment (DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) to cross-reference).
- Rune Connection: She recognizes the markers’ runes as elven wards, offering a chant to aid activation (advantage on DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks if used).
- Hearthstone’s Secret: Lirien believes the hearthstone is the ward’s keystone, proposing a ritual to restore it. She knows Mirra’s family maintained it, linking to Ysmeine’s flute.
- Carival Stanislain: She’s heard rumors of a “hooded sorcerer” meeting Retch, suspecting he seeks the pearl for dark magic. She warns the party of his manipulation.
- Smugglers and Sahuagin: Lirien’s notes mention smugglers trading with “fish-folk,” connecting Kael Draven’s camp to the sahuagin priestess. She suggests investigating Retch’s shack.

Interaction with the Party

- Encounter: The party finds Lirien in the Hearth, her journal open as she sketches the hearthstone’s runes. 
- Dialogue Options:
    - Persuasion (DC 13 Charisma): Share the map fragment for her aid. Success gains her support and the chant; failure requires a favor (e.g., retrieving an artifact).
    - Investigation (DC 14 Intelligence): Ask about the hearthstone. Success reveals its ritual history; failure needs Torren’s input.
    - Intimidation (DC 15 Charisma): Demand her knowledge. Success yields the shrine lead; failure makes her wary.
- Quest Offer: She hires the party (50 gp total) to explore a forest cave 14 miles north, where she believes the shrine lies, containing a ritual scroll to seal the ward.
- [[Forest Cave]]
- Combat: Unlikely, but if threatened, she casts Silence and flees, using Bardic Inspiration to aid an ally (e.g., a sailor).


> [!WARNING]
>  Carival’s Pursuit: He learns of Lirien’s research, sending 2 Cultists (CR 1/8) to steal her journal, intersecting the party.

> - Scaling: For Level 2, reduce blights to 1. For Level 6+, include a Sahuagin Baron (CR 5) at the shrine.
> - Tie-Ins: Lirien bridges the hearthstone, markers, and wreck, offering lore and quests. Her journal ties to Carival and Valthor, expanding the arc.
