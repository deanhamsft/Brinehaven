Retch, the Smuggler

Background

- Full Name: Rethgar "Retch" Veyl
- Race: Half-Elf
- Age: 38
- Occupation: Smuggler, Information Broker
- History: Retch is a wiry half-elf with a shady past, born to a human sailor and an elven trader in a coastal port far from Brinehaven. He lost his left eye to a sahuagin raid years ago, earning his nickname from the stench of his scarred, disfigured face—a wound he masks with a leather patch. Retch joined Kael Draven’s smuggling ring after fleeing debt collectors, becoming a trusted scout and intermediary. His shack near the lighthouse at Stormwatch Point serves as a hideout where he trades contraband and gathers intel on shipwrecks, including the Auror’s Bounty. He’s met the cloaked stranger who gave the party their map fragment, hinting at a larger conspiracy involving the wreck’s treasure.

Personality

- Traits: Cunning, paranoid, opportunistic. Retch is a survivor who trusts no one fully, always looking for an angle to profit or escape trouble. His missing eye and scarred face make him self-conscious, but he uses this to intimidate or garner sympathy.
- Ideal: Wealth above loyalty—Retch will sell information to the highest bidder but won’t betray Kael unless the price is right.
- Bond: A hidden locket with a picture of his elven mother, the only memento of his past he refuses to part with.
- Flaw: Greedy and quick to flee when outnumbered, leaving allies behind if it means saving his skin.

    - Pouch with 25 gp and 50 sp
    - Locket (sentimental value, DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to notice its elven craftsmanship)
- Special Item: A wax-sealed letter from the cloaked stranger, detailing a meeting to trade a “sea relic” for the wreck’s location (requires DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to open without breaking the seal).

Hideout: The Lighthouse Shack

- Location: Situated 2 miles south of Brinehaven at Stormwatch Point, near the abandoned lighthouse ruins. The shack is a dilapidated wooden structure (10x10 ft) built against the lighthouse’s crumbling base, camouflaged with driftwood and moss.
- Interior:
    - Main Room: A single room with a rickety table, a straw mattress, and a locked chest (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) to open, contains 100 gp, a Potion of Invisibility, and a sketch of the Auror’s Bounty wreck).
    - Trap: A pressure plate near the chest triggers a Dart Trap (DC 14 Dexterity save, 1d4+2 piercing damage plus 1d4 poison damage).
    - Hidden Compartment: Under the mattress, a loose board hides a journal (DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) to find) with entries about sahuagin tribute and a meeting with Kael Draven.
- Defenses: A tripwire outside the door (DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) to spot, DC 12 Dexterity save or fall prone) and a lookout perch atop the lighthouse ruins (50 ft climb, DC 13 Strength (Athletics)).
- Current Status: Retch is present at 12:41 PM MDT, preparing to meet smugglers, but he’ll flee if combat looms (using Cunning Action to Disengage).

Key Information and Items

- Shipwreck Knowledge: Retch knows the Auror’s Bounty lies 2 miles offshore from Blackreef Cove, 200 ft deep, guarded by a magical barrier. He’s heard rumors of a “trident-wielding shadow” (likely the guardian) and believes the rune markers can unlock it.
- Cloaked Stranger: The wax-sealed letter implicates the stranger as a sea cultist seeking the wreck’s relic (e.g., a cursed pearl). Retch met him a month ago, describing him as “tall, hooded, with a voice like the tide.”
- Map Fragment: A second piece of the treasure map, showing a ritual circle that matches the coastal markers’ runes (requires DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) to connect to the party’s fragment).
- Sahuagin Tie: His journal mentions trading with a sahuagin priestess for safe passage, suggesting their interest in the wreck’s gold.

Interaction with the Party

- Approach: The party can reach the shack by following the coastal path from the docks (1-hour trek, DC 12 Constitution save or 1 level of exhaustion). Retch spots them from the lookout (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) vs. party’s Stealth).
- Dialogue Options:
    - Intimidation (DC 15 Charisma): Threaten Retch to spill his secrets. Success yields the wreck’s location and letter; failure makes him hostile.
    - Persuasion (DC 13 Charisma): Offer gold (50 gp minimum) or safety from Kael. Success gains the journal and map fragment; failure requires a bribe.
    - Deception (DC 14 Charisma): Pretend to be Kael’s allies. Success unlocks the chest; failure alerts Retch to attack.
- Combat: If fought, Retch uses Sneak Attack and flees after 1 round, heading toward the smugglers’ camp (5 miles north). His HP (21) and mobility make him a skirmisher challenge for a Level 3-4 party.
- Reward: Surrendering Retch to Brinehaven’s elders (e.g., via Mirra) earns favor (free room at the Hearth for a week) and a lead to Kael’s camp.

Adventure Hooks

1. The Ritual Circle: The map fragment’s ritual circle suggests activating the markers requires a specific chant (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) to decipher from the journal), potentially bypassing the sea spirit.
2. Sahuagin Ambush: Retch’s sahuagin deal draws 1d6 sahuagin (CR 1/2) to the shack within 10 minutes of his capture, seeking the letter.
3. Kael’s Retribution: If Retch escapes, Kael sends Veyra "Silent Blade" (Level 4 Fighter) and 2 Level 2 smugglers to silence him, intersecting the party.
4. Cloaked Stranger’s Plan: The letter hints at a meeting tonight at Blackreef Cove. Infiltrating it (DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth)) could reveal the stranger’s identity (e.g., a sea cult priest, CR 5).

> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> - Level Suitability: Retch (CR 1) and his shack suit a Level 2-4 party of six. Add the trap and sahuagin for Level 3-5, or Kael’s retaliation for Level 5+.
> - Tie-Ins: Retch connects the smugglers, sahuagin, and the Auror’s Bounty plot. His information accelerates the "Rune Connection" quest, linking to the markers and wreck.
> - Time Pressure: The 1-hour trek and potential 6 PM MDT storm (from the weather forecast) urge quick action. Retch’s escape could delay the party’s plans.
> - Roleplay Focus: His paranoia and greed offer negotiation depth. The locket could be a side quest (e.g., returning it to his mother’s village for a reward).
> 
> This fleshed-out Retch adds a layer of intrigue and a tactical encounter to the campaign. If you’d like a shack map, expanded stats for his pursuers, or a scene with the cloaked stranger, let me know!
