> - Theme: A corrupted elven sanctuary, overtaken by the pearl’s influence, featuring natural hazards, minor undead, and a ritual site.
> - Level Suitability: Designed for a Level 2 party (CR 1/2 to 1 encounters, totaling 600-800 XP for 4-6 players).

Dungeon Layout

The cave consists of five chambers, connected by narrow, winding tunnels (5 ft wide, difficult terrain due to roots and rocks, DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to move at full speed). Each chamber is 20x20 ft unless noted, with 10-ft-high ceilings. The map is linear with optional side paths.
[[Cave Monsters]]

**Chamber 1: Entrance Cavern**

- Description: **A damp chamber with a low ceiling draped in vines. A faint glow emanates from bioluminescent moss, revealing an elven carving of a bird (History check DC 10 (Aerdrie Faenya’s symbol)) above the entrance.**
- Inhabitants: 2 Giant Spiders (CR 1, Monster Manual p. 328), lurking in webs (*DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) to spot*).
- Features: A tripwire trap (DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) to notice, DC 12 Dexterity save or 2d6 bludgeoning from falling rocks, 10 ft range).
- Challenge: Combat (120 XP total) or Stealth (DC 13) to avoid. A DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) on the carving reveals a hint: “The ward begins with song.”
- Loot: 10 gp in a web sack.

**Chamber 2: Root-Choked Passage**

- Description: **A narrow tunnel clogged with gnarled roots, dimly lit by glowing fungi. The air smells of decay, hinting at corruption.**
- Inhabitants: 1 Ghoul (CR 1, Monster Manual p. 148), a corrupted elven guardian, risen due to the pearl’s curse.
- Features: Thick roots (difficult terrain, half speed) and a hidden alcove (DC 13 Wisdom (Perception)) with an elven dagger (10 gp value).
- Challenge: Combat (200 XP) or a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) to calm the ghoul with a song (ties to Aerdrie or Ysmeine’s flute). Failure triggers a claw attack (2d6+2 necrotic).
- Loot: The dagger and 5 gp in a rotted pouch.

**Chamber 3: Crystal Grotto**

- Description: **A circular chamber with crystalline walls reflecting faint light. A shallow pool (5 ft deep) dominates the center, home to tiny glowing fish.**
- Inhabitants: None, but a Water Weird (CR 3, Monster Manual p. 299, scaled to CR 1 with 22 HP and 1 attack) guards the pool if disturbed.
- Features: A submerged chest (DC 12 Strength (Athletics) to lift, DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) to unlock) contains a Potion of Water Breathing.
- Challenge: Exploration (DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) to avoid the weird) or combat (200 XP). Disturbing the pool alerts the next chamber.
- Loot: The potion and 15 gp in pearls.

**Chamber 4: Ritual Niche**

- Description: **A small, arched chamber with an altar carved with faded runes. A skeleton in elven robes lies slumped, clutching a journal**.
- Inhabitants: 1 Shadow (CR 1/2, Monster Manual p. 269), the spirit of the shrine’s last priest, corrupted by the pearl.
- Features: The journal (DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation)) details the Auror’s Bounty’s curse and a chant to seal the ward. The runes match the hearthstone (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) to activate, requires Ysmeine’s flute or a song).
- Challenge: Combat (100 XP) or a DC 13 Wisdom (Religion) to banish the shadow with Aerdrie’s prayer. Failure summons 2d4 stirges (CR 1/8) from the ceiling.
- Loot: Journal (plot item), 20 gp in a ceremonial bowl.

**Chamber 5: Shrine Sanctum**

- Description: **A 30x30 ft chamber with a high ceiling, dominated by a statue of Aerdrie Faenya as a bird-woman. The air hums with faint magic, and a pedestal holds a cracked orb.**
- Inhabitants: None, but activating the orb summons a Specter (CR 1, Monster Manual p. 279) if the ward isn’t sealed.
- Features: The orb (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)) is a Pearl of Power fragment, requiring the chant to unlock (restores 1 spell level, 1/long rest). The statue’s base has a hidden compartment (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation)) with a Scroll of Lesser Restoration.
- Challenge: Ritual (DC 15 Charisma (Performance) with flute or song to seal the ward) or combat (200 XP if unsealed). Success ends the specter threat.
- Loot: Pearl of Power fragment, scroll, 25 gp in offerings.

Dungeon Flow

- Entry (Chamber 1): The party faces spiders, setting the tone with a combat or stealth choice.
- Progression (Chambers 2-3): Root passage and grotto offer exploration and a tougher fight, building tension.
- Climax (Chambers 4-5): The ritual niche and sanctum tie to the campaign, rewarding lore and a moral choice (seal the ward or keep the pearl).

Campaign Integration

- Ysmeine’s Tie: The journal is her mother’s, confirming the flute’s role in the ward. She joins if persuaded (DC 12 Charisma).
- Hearthstone’s Secret: The chant seals the ward, linking to the hearthstone ritual (requires return to Brinehaven).
- Auror’s Bounty: The curse’s origin ties to the shrine, suggesting the pearl’s removal weakened it.
- Carival and Smugglers: Carival’s cult may track the party here, sending 2 Cultists (CR 1/8) if they linger.
