[[The Rune Stones]]
[[The Brinehaven Hearth]]

**The hearthstone in the Brinehaven Hearth, a massive rune-carved stone at the tavern’s heart, is more than a decorative relic. Local legend, shared by Torren Gale, claims it glowed during a recent storm, suggesting a magical ward or connection to the sea. Mirra Gale hinted that its runes resemble those in her mother’s recipes, linking it to the half-elven heritage of Brinehaven. This stone is revealed to be a keystone in an ancient elven ritual, one of four markers (including the three coastal stones) designed to protect or unlock the Auror’s Bounty wreck. Its activation, tied to "The Rune Connection," can either reinforce the ward against sahuagin or reveal the wreck’s full location, depending on the party’s actions.**

The Hearthstone’s Details

- Location: Centrally placed in the Brinehaven Hearth’s fireplace, a 4-foot-wide, 2-foot-thick slab of smooth black stone veined with quartz. The runes, etched in an ancient elven script, glow faintly when magic is near.
- History: Carved 1,000 years ago by Brinehaven’s founding elven druids, the hearthstone anchors a ward to protect the village from sea threats (e.g., sahuagin, storms). It’s tied to the Auror’s Bounty’s sinking, where a cursed relic (a pearl) was lost, weakening the ward over centuries.
- Current State: The stone’s glow intensified during last night’s storm, hinting at its reactivation. Mirra believes her mother’s half-elven blood links her family to its maintenance, a duty neglected since her mother’s death.

Activation Process

- Requirements: The party must activate the three coastal markers (docks, Blackreef Cove, Stormwatch Point) first, as outlined in "The Rune Connection." The hearthstone activation requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check in the Hearth, with Ysmeine’s flute played (DC 13 Performance check) to harmonize the runes.
- Procedure:
    1. Gather at the Hearth (assumed after returning from the markers).
    2. Place the map fragment and flute near the hearthstone.
    3. Chant the deciphered rune phrase (“The tide guards, the stones sing, the spirit frees”) from the markers.
    4. Roll the Arcana check; success links all four sites, failure triggers a backlash.
- Outcomes:
    - Success: A holographic map projects, showing the Auror’s Bounty’s wreck and a ritual circle around the pearl. The ward strengthens, reducing sahuagin aggression (DM discretion, e.g., -2 to their attack rolls in Brinehaven for 1 week).
    - Failure: A Storm of Vengeance (as the spell, 360-ft radius, 1 minute) erupts over Brinehaven, forcing evacuation unless dispelled (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)).
    - Sea Spirit: Instead of a map, a Marid (CR 11, neutral) appears, offering to remove the pearl’s curse for a price (e.g., 50 gp per PC or a promise to slay the guardian).

Exploration and Roleplay

- Torren’s Lore: He recalls an elder’s tale of the hearthstone calming a storm 50 years ago, suggesting a ritual chant (DC 15 Intelligence (History) to recall it, aiding the Arcana check).
- Mirra’s Concern: She offers a protective charm (a seashell pendant, +1 AC for 1 hour, 1 use) if the party promises to protect Brinehaven from the ritual’s fallout (DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion)).
- Ysmeine’s Role: Her flute’s glow intensifies near the hearthstone, triggering a vision of her mother performing the ritual (DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) to interpret: the pearl must be destroyed to lift the curse).
- Marid Negotiation: The spirit demands the pearl’s retrieval and destruction, offering a Ring of Swimming as reward. Refusal leads to a fight (casts Create or Destroy Water and Ice Storm).

Tie-In with The Rune Connection

- Synergy: The coastal markers’ activations power the hearthstone, forming a ritual network. The docks marker’s “tide guards” phrase, Blackreef’s “stones align,” and Stormwatch’s “spirit frees” align with the hearthstone’s “gold tide” to unlock the wreck.
- Guardian Link: The Marid reveals the guardian (e.g., a Kraken Priest, CR 5) is bound to the pearl, explaining the sahuagin’s aggression. The ritual’s success weakens this bond, easing access.
- Smuggler Connection: Retch’s journal (from his shack) mentions Kael trading with sahuagin for the pearl, tying the smugglers to the curse’s spread.

Adventure Hooks

1. Pearl Quest: The Marid’s demand leads to a wreck dive (200 ft deep, requiring Water Breathing or a boat). The priest guards the pearl, demanding a blood sacrifice to release it.
2. Sahuagin Raid: The weakened ward post-ritual draws a sahuagin warband (6-8, CR 1/2) to Brinehaven that night, testing the party’s defense.
3. Cloaked Stranger’s Move: The stranger, revealed as a sea cultist, attacks the Hearth to claim the pearl’s power, bringing 2 Cult Fanatics (CR 2) and a Water Elemental.
4. Elven Legacy: Ysmeine’s vision suggests a hidden elven shrine in the forest, holding a ritual scroll to permanently seal the ward (DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to find).

> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> - Level Range: Suitable for a Level 3-5 party of six. The Marid (CR 11) is a narrative foe; combat is optional. Add sahuagin or smugglers for Level 6+.
> - Pacing: The trek to markers (morning), shack visit (midday), and ritual (evening) fit a day’s play. The 6 PM MDT storm deadline adds urgency.
> - Scaling: For Level 1-2, reduce to two markers and a Mage Hand backlash. For Level 6+, include a Sahuagin Baron (CR 5) with the warband.
> - Rewards: The map or Ring of Swimming, plus village gratitude (free supplies for a week), balance the risks.
