Smugglers' Camp Description

Location: Nestled in a narrow cove 5 miles north of Brinehaven, the camp is concealed by dense coastal pines and a rocky outcrop that shields it from sea view. The stony beach is littered with driftwood and seaweed, and a shallow cave at the cove’s rear serves as the smugglers’ storage. A rickety dock extends into the water, mooring two small boats for smuggling runs. The camp features a central fire pit, several lean-tos made of salvaged wood and canvas, and a guarded lookout post atop the outcrop. The air carries the scent of saltwater, smoke, and tar, with the distant sound of waves masking their operations.

Population: 25 total (17 men, 8 women), with 12-13 present at any time (randomly determine absences, e.g., roll 1d4+9 for present members). The group is a mix of human and half-elf smugglers, hardened by years of evading coastal patrols and trading contraband, including rumored relics from the Auror’s Bounty.Leadership:

- Leader (Level 5): Kael "Blackwave" Draven, a cunning rogue with a scarred face and a silver tongue.
- Lieutenant (Level 4): Veyra "Silent Blade" Tormen, a stealthy fighter who enforces Kael’s orders.

Members:

- Two Level 3 members: Roric "Hookhand" Veyl (rogue) and Lysa "Shade" Corren (ranger).
- Remaining 21 members are Level 1 or 2, split roughly evenly (11 Level 1, 10 Level 2), with varied rogue, fighter, or sailor backgrounds.

Camp Defenses: 
The lookout post has a bell to signal intruders (heard 300 ft away). 
Traps include a tripwire with a net (DC 13 Dexterity save to avoid, restrained until freed with DC 12 Strength check) near the cave entrance and a concealed pit (10 ft deep, DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) to spot, DC 12 Dexterity save to avoid 2d6 bludgeoning damage). 

Two guard dogs (use Guard Dog stats, CR 1/8) patrol the perimeter.
Loot: The cave contains crates of smuggled goods (rum, silks, 150 gp worth), a locked chest (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) to open, holds 300 gp and a Potion of Healing), and a partial map fragment of the Auror’s Bounty wreck, guarded by Kael.

Adventure Hooks

1. **The Smuggler’s Map:** The partial map fragment in the cave points to Blackreef Cove, suggesting Kael knows the Auror’s Bounty’s location. Infiltrating the camp (DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth)) could reveal his deal with the cloaked stranger.
2. **Sahuagin Alliance:** Tracks near the cave lead to sahuagin offerings, hinting at a pact. A DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check uncovers a note from a sahuagin priestess demanding tribute for the wreck’s protection.
3. **Betrayal Plot:** Veyra grows uneasy with Kael’s greed and might turn informant if the party offers safety (DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion)). She knows a back route into the camp.
4. **Ambush Setup:** The smugglers plan a raid on Brinehaven to silence rumors. The party can intercept them (6-7 members, including Roric and Lysa) en route, gaining allies or loot.

> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> - Encounter Balance: The camp’s 12-13 present members (e.g., Kael, Veyra, Roric, Lysa, 3 Level 2, 5 Level 1) suit a Level 3-5 party of six. Kael’s Sneak Attack and Veyra’s Action Surge make them dangerous leaders. Adjust absences or add traps for higher levels.
> - Tactics: Smugglers use the cave for cover, the lookout for ranged attacks (longbows or shortbows), and dogs to flank. Kael flees with the map if reduced to 10 HP, triggering a chase.
> - Tie-In: The smugglers’ map fragment and sahuagin connection link to the Auror’s Bounty plot, suggesting they’re pawns in a larger scheme by the cloaked stranger or a sea cult.
