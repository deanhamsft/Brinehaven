**The Auror’s Bounty was an imperial galleon launched 300 years ago, tasked with transporting a vast hoard of gold, jeweled relics, and a cursed pearl—a relic stolen from an elven sea shrine—back to the empire’s capital. During a violent storm off Brinehaven’s coast, the ship struck a reef, sinking with all hands. The pearl’s curse bound the captain’s spirit to guard the wreck, attracting sahuagin and weakening the elven ward anchored by the hearthstone and coastal markers. The wreck now lies 2 miles southeast of Blackreef Cove, 200 ft below the surface, its decayed hull a labyrinth of treasure and peril.**

Location and Access

- Coordinates: 2 miles southeast of Blackreef Cove, in deep coastal waters. The "Rune Connection" ritual or the Marid’s lore pinpoints this location.
- Depth: 200 ft, requiring Water Breathing (spell, potion, or magic item) or a submersible (e.g., a smuggler’s diving bell, DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to locate from Retch’s shack).
- Travel: A rowboat from Brinehaven takes 1 hour (DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) to navigate). The dive descent takes 10 minutes (DC 13 Constitution save or 1 level of exhaustion from pressure).
- Current Conditions: At 02:01 PM MDT, the sea is calm, but a storm is forecast for 6 PM MDT, risking rough waters (disadvantage on navigation checks).

Wreck Layout

**The Auror’s Bounty is a three-deck wooden galleon, 150 ft long and 40 ft wide, broken into three main sections due to the reef impact. The map is oriented with the bow (front) to the north and stern (rear) to the south.**

1. Upper Deck (Partially Exposed)

	- Description: The top deck is splintered, with the forecastle and mainmast collapsed. Seaweed and barnacles cover the wood, and the ship lists 45 degrees to starboard.
	- Inhabitants: 2 sahuagin (CR 1/2) patrol, using the wreckage for cover.
	- Features:
	    - Broken Cannon: A rusted cannon (half cover, +2 AC) can be dislodged (DC 15 Strength check) to create a 10-ft debris field (difficult terrain).
	    - Captain’s Bell: A cracked bell (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation)) rings faintly, alerting the captain’s ghost if struck.
	    - Challenge: Strong currents (DC 13 Strength (Athletics) to swim, or drift 15 ft per round). 
	

2. Mid Deck (Flooded Crew Quarters)

	- Description: A 20-ft-deep flooded section with collapsed bulkheads. Bunks and barrels float amid the murk, visibility 10 ft (heavily obscured beyond).
	- Inhabitants: 1 sahuagin priestess (CR 2, Monster Manual p. 264) leads 3 sahuagin, performing a ritual to claim the pearl’s power.
	- Features:
	    - Treasure Chest: Locked (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools)), contains 200 gp, a Pearl of Power, and a jeweled dagger (50 gp).
	    - Ritual Circle: A glowing circle (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)) channels the pearl’s curse, requiring a dispel (DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana)) to weaken the guardian.
	- The priestess casts Spiritual Weapon (trident form) if attacked.

3. Lower Deck (Hold and Captain’s Cabin)

	- Description: The deepest section, 30 ft down, with the cargo hold breached and the captain’s cabin intact. The hull is cracked, leaking bubbles and debris.
	- Inhabitants: The Ghost of Captain Eryndor (CR 4, Monster Manual p. 147, with Trident of Fish Command variant), bound to the pearl, guards the treasure.
	- Features:
	    - Cargo Hold: Piles of gold coins (1,000 gp), silver bars (500 gp), and rusted weapons. A trapped chest (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) to spot, Poison Needle trap, 2d10 poison damage, DC 13 Constitution save) holds a Cloak of the Manta Ray.
	    - Captain’s Cabin: A desk with a logbook (details the pearl’s theft, DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)) and the cursed pearl (attuned, imposes Exhaustion level 1 on touch until removed).
	- Challenge: The ghost’s Withering Touch (4d6+3 necrotic) targets the pearl holder. Dispelling the curse (DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana), requires Ysmeine’s flute) frees it.

Key Elements

- Cursed Pearl: A black pearl with swirling runes, the source of the wreck’s curse. Removing it without dispelling the ritual triggers a Chain Lightning effect (6d10 damage, DC 15 Dexterity save, 30-ft radius) and summons 1d4 sahuagin reinforcements.
- Magical Barrier: A ward (DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) to dispel) surrounds the lower deck, linked to the hearthstone and markers. Success with the ritual (from "The Hearthstone’s Secret") lowers it.
- Guardian: Captain Eryndor’s ghost, a spectral figure in imperial armor, wields a Trident of Fish Command (summons 1d3 giant sharks, CR 1/2, for 1 hour). Defeating him requires destroying the pearl or completing the elven ritual.

Challenges and Encounters

- Depth Pressure: Every 10 minutes underwater, a DC 13 Constitution save or gain 1 level of exhaustion (mitigated by Water Breathing or pressure-resistant gear).
- Sahuagin Ambush: The priestess alerts 1d6 sahuagin if intruders are detected, arriving in 2 rounds via the water.
- Smuggler Interference: Kael Draven’s crew (Veyra and 2 Level 2 smugglers) may dive with a stolen diving bell, arriving 30 minutes after the party if not intercepted.
- Environmental Hazards: Collapsing debris (DC 14 Dexterity save, 2d6 bludgeoning) if the hold is disturbed, and a reef current (DC 12 Strength (Athletics) to resist, pushes 20 ft).

Rewards and Loot

- Treasure: 1,500 gp (coins and bars), Pearl of Power, Cloak of the Manta Ray, jeweled dagger (50 gp), Trident of Fish Command (if purified).
- Lore: The logbook reveals the pearl’s theft angered a sea spirit, cursing the ship. Returning it to the elven shrine (a side quest) lifts the ward’s strain on Brinehaven.
- XP: 2,000 XP for clearing the wreck, plus 500 XP for dispelling the curse (Level 3-5 party scale).

Adventure Flow

1. Preparation: The party secures Water Breathing (e.g., from Torren, 50 gp per dose) and a boat, planning the dive.
2. Journey: Row to the wreck site, facing a possible smuggler ambush en route.
3. Exploration: Navigate the decks, combat sahuagin and the ghost, and decide the pearl’s fate before the storm hits.
4. Resolution: Return to Brinehaven with treasure or the pearl, triggering sahuagin retaliation or cultist pursuit.

> [!NOTE]
> DM Notes
> 
> - Level Range: Designed for a Level 4-6 party of six. The ghost (CR 4) and priestess (CR 2) with sahuagin (CR 1/2) offer a balanced challenge. Adjust with sharks or smugglers for Level 3 or 7+.
> - Scaling: For Level 3, reduce sahuagin to 2 and skip the priestess. For Level 7+, add a Kraken (CR 23) fragment as the guardian, scaled down (CR 10).
> - Time Pressure: The 6 PM MDT storm deadline urges speed. Underwater combat favors magic (e.g., Control Water) over melee.
> - Moral Choice: Destroying the pearl frees the captain but weakens Brinehaven’s ward; keeping it risks the curse spreading.
