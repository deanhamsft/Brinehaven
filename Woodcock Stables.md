Location and Description

- Location: Situated southeast of Brinehaven, approximately 1 mile from the village center along a winding dirt path through pine groves and open fields. The stables are near the forest edge, offering a scenic view of the coastal cliffs.
- Structure: A sturdy wooden stable complex with a main barn (40x20 ft), a fenced paddock (60x40 ft), and a small tack shed. The barn’s weathered sign, carved with a woodcock bird, creaks in the breeze. The air smells of hay, leather, and horse sweat, with the occasional bray of a donkey adding charm.
- Purpose: Woodcock Stables boards local horses and donkeys, rents them to travelers, and sells basic riding gear. It’s a vital link for Brinehaven’s trade with inland villages, including the route to Tinkertwist Hollow.

**The party finds a burly man with a weathered face, a graying beard, and a limp from an old injury. He wears a patched leather vest over a wool shirt, and his hands are calloused from years of handling beasts.**
**He is in the paddock, brushing a graying stallion as the sun filters through the pines. He greets you with a hearty, “As you have no livery with you, I assume you'd like to secure some mounts?”**

Stable Details

- Animals:
    - Horses (6 available): Riding horses (2 gp/day rental, 75 gp to buy), sturdy but skittish near the coast.
    - Donkeys (4 available): Hardy pack animals (7 sp/day rental, 10 gp to buy), slow but reliable for cargo.
    - Old Thunder: Cavlin’s retired warhorse (not for rent), a graying stallion with a gentle demeanor (use Warhorse stats, CR 1/2, but non-combat).
- Services:
    - Boarding: 5 sp/day per animal, including feed and grooming.
    - Renting: Requires a 50% deposit (returned if undamaged) and a signed agreement (DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) to spot fine print about liability).
    - Gear: Saddles (5 gp), bridles (2 gp), saddlebags (4 gp), and a “Gnomish Speed Stirrup” (5 gp, +5 ft speed but 10% chance to jam, DC 10 Dexterity check to fix).
- Special Feature: A “Whinny Wall” where horses “vote” on weather with hoof taps—Cavlin swears it’s 80% accurate (roll 1d6: 1-2 rain, 3-4 clear, 5-6 storm).

Campaign Integration

- Travel Hub: The stables are key for the eight-day ride to Tinkertwist Hollow  or the three-week trek to Valthor’s fortress. Renting horses saves time (DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) for a discount).
- The Auror’s Bounty: A trader boarding a horse mentioned a “hooded man” (Carival) inquiring about coastal routes, linking to the wreck.
- Rune Connection/Hearthstone’s Secret: Cavlin recalls an old rider leaving a rune-etched saddlebag near the forest cave, suggesting a marker tie-in (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) to find it).
- Carival and Smugglers: Cavlin’s ex-soldier instincts suspect Kael’s crew of horse theft—investigating (DC 13 Wisdom (Survival)) reveals tracks to the smugglers’ camp.
- Ysmeine and Lirien: Ysmeine’s father trades fish with Cavlin, offering a lead to the cave. Lirien might visit for historical horse routes, aiding marker research.

Interaction with the Party

- Encounter: The party finds Cavlin in the paddock, brushing a graying stallion as the morning sun filters through the pines. He greets them with a hearty, “Need a steed or a story?”
- Dialogue Options:
    - Persuasion (DC 12 Charisma): Negotiate a rental deal. Success lowers costs by 10%; failure requires a favor (e.g., fixing a fence).
    - Insight (DC 13 Wisdom): Probe his knowledge. Success reveals the trader’s rumor; failure needs a gift (e.g., 5 gp).
    - Athletics (DC 14 Strength): Help with a heavy task (e.g., moving hay). Success earns a free day’s rental; failure amuses him.
- Quest Offer: Cavlin asks the party to retrieve a lost donkey, “Brayzor,” wandered into the forest (5 gp reward).
- Combat: Unlikely, but if threatened, Cavlin uses Second Wind and calls stablehands (2 Commoners, CR 0) for help. His 17 HP suits a minor skirmish.

Brayzor Retrieval Quest

- Location: 2.5 miles west. Must be a successful tracking check to find
- Description: Brayzor (use Donkey stats, CR 1/8) is stuck in mud, haried by 1 Boar (CR 1/4) and 1 Stirge (CR 1/8).
- Challenge: DC 12 Strength (Athletics) to free Brayzor, DC 13 Dexterity save to avoid the stirge’s blood drain (1d4+1 piercing + 1d4 exhaustion).
- Reward: 20 gp and Brayzor’s loyalty (carries 50 lbs extra for free).

DM Notes

- Level Range: Quests and encounters suit Levels 2-3 (CR 1/8-1/2, 100-200 XP). Scale with 1 Wolf (CR 1/4) for Level 4.
- Pacing: The 1-mile trip fits a morning session (10:10 AM - 12:00 PM MDT), aligning with travel prep.
- Humor: Cavlin’s Whinny Wall and Brayzor’s stubbornness add levity, balancing Brinehaven’s tension.
- Rewards: 20-50 gp and rentals support Level 2-3 needs.
