| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Brine-Tainted Wolves (Combat)     | A pack of 4–6 wolves (CR 1/4 each) warped by the salty fog, their fur matted with crystalline brine. They howl with an unnatural, echoing keen that alerts nearby threats.                                                       | Total CR 1–2. Treasure: A wolf pelt worth 10 gp, or a potion of animal friendship hidden in their den. |
| 2        | Smuggler's Camp (Social/Combat)   | 3–4 human bandits (CR 1/8 each) and a scout (CR 1/2) huddled around a fire, guarding crates of illicit arcane components from Brinehaven's black market. They might trade info on town secrets for a bribe or fight if provoked. | Total CR 1. Roleplay hook: They seek a lost demonic relic; aiding them could lead to a side quest.     |
| 3        | Feywild Glimpse (Exploration)     | A shimmering portal to the Feywild flickers open briefly, revealing glowing fruits on twisted vines. Eating one grants temporary wild shape (1 hour) but risks fey mischief (e.g., speaking only in rhymes).                     | Non-combat. Hazard: DC 13 Wisdom save or be charmed by playful dryads.                                 |
| 4        | Lost Traveler (Social)            | A disoriented elf merchant from Brinehaven, separated from their caravan. They offer a map to a hidden grove in exchange for escort back to the road.                                                                            | Non-combat. Reward: 50 gp and rumors of a buried smugglers' cache.                                     |
| 5        | Salt Mephit Swarm (Combat/Hazard) | 2d4 salt mephits (CR 1/2 each) erupt from a brine pool, spewing corrosive mist (DC 12 Dexterity save or 1d6 acid damage).                                                                                                        | Total CR 1–2. Environment: The pool could be a trap or lead to an underground stream.                  |
| 6        | Druidic Ruin (Exploration)        | Overgrown stone circle etched with faded runes, once a ward against demonic incursions. Disturbing it summons spectral guardians (2 shadows, CR 1/2 each) that test the party's worthiness.                                      | Total CR 1. Loot: A scroll of protection from evil and good.                                           |
| 7        | Feral Boar Charge (Combat)        | A giant boar (CR 2) roots through underbrush, startled by the party. Its tusks drip with brackish venom (DC 11 Constitution save or poisoned for 1 hour).                                                                        | Single CR 2. Alternative: Tame it with Animal Handling (DC 15) for a mount.                            |
| 8        | Whispering Winds (Hazard)         | Eerie gusts carry fragmented voices—echoes of Brinehaven's cursed dead—imposing disadvantage on concentration checks. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals clues to a local ghost story.                       | Non-combat. Prolonged exposure risks short-term madness (1d4 hours).                                   |
| 9        | Goblin Scavengers (Combat/Social) | 1d6+2 goblins (CR 1/4 each) picking over a fresh battlefield (perhaps from a recent town skirmish). They flee if outnumbered but bargain with stolen trinkets.                                                                   | Total CR 1–2. Treasure: 2d10 gp in mixed coinage and a bag of holding (tiny).                          |
| 10       | Herbalist's Grove (Exploration)   | A serene clearing with rare brinebloom herbs (used in potions against poison). Harvesting requires a DC 13 Nature check; failure attracts 1d4 stirges (CR 1/8 each).                                                             | Total CR 0–1. Reward: Ingredients for 2 potions of resistance (poison).                                |
| 11       | Demonic Imp (Social/Combat)       | A mischievous imp (CR 1) disguised as a lost child, tempting the party with forbidden knowledge from Brinehaven's underbelly. It flees invisibly if attacked.                                                                    | Single CR 1. Hook: It offers a pact boon but at the cost of a future favor.                            |
| 12       | Patrolling Guard (Social)         | 2 guards (CR 1/8 each) from Brinehaven on a routine patrol for deserters or monsters. They demand tolls (10 gp/person) but share news of town events.                                                                            | Non-combat unless provoked. Insight (DC 12) reveals they're corrupt and open to bribes.                |
| 13       | Vine Blight Ambush (Combat)       | 1 vine blight (CR 1/2) and 2d4 twig blights (CR 1/8 each) ensnare travelers, their roots pulsing with stolen arcane energy.                                                                                                      | Total CR 1–2. Environment: Entangling vines (DC 13 Strength save to escape).                           |
| 14       | Abandoned Caravan (Exploration)   | Wreckage of a merchant wagon, looted but hiding a locked chest (DC 15 Thieves' Tools or knock). Inside: A cursed amulet of health that attracts undead at night.                                                                 | Non-combat. Lore: Journal entries hint at a demonic cult in the woods.                                 |
| 15       | Harpy Lure (Combat/Hazard)        | A harpy (CR 1) sings from a cliffside perch, luring prey (DC 13 Wisdom save or charmed). Her nest holds shiny baubles from drowned sailors.                                                                                      | Single CR 1. Treasure: 30 gp in jewelry and a driftglobe.                                              |
| 16       | Mystic Spring (Exploration)       | A bubbling spring infused with fey magic; bathing heals 2d4+2 HP but imposes vulnerability to fire for 24 hours.                                                                                                                 | Non-combat. Arcana (DC 14) identifies it as a site of ancient pacts.                                   |
| 17       | Blighted Dryad (Combat/Social)    | A corrupted dryad (treat as satyr, CR 1/2, with poison damage) guards a poisoned tree, demanding tribute to pass. She might ally against greater forest threats.                                                                 | Single CR 1/2. Hook: Curing her blight (DC 15 Medicine or lesser restoration) gains a woodland ally.   |
| 18       | Rogue Mage's Lair (Social/Combat) | An exiled wizard (CR 6, scaled down to mage stats) hiding from Brinehaven authorities. They offer arcane tutelage or unleash fireball if threatened.                                                                             | Single CR 6 (adjust for party). Reward: Spell scrolls and a wand of magic missiles (3 charges).        |
| 19       | Spectral Procession (Hazard)      | Ghostly figures of drowned sailors march silently through the mist (harmless but eerie). Passing through requires DC 13 Charisma save or gain a level of exhaustion from chilling fear.                                          | Non-combat. Opportunity: Follow them to a haunted cove with sunken treasure.                           |
| 20       | Forest Guardian (Combat/Roleplay) | A treant sapling (young treant, CR 3) awakens, mistaking the party for blight-spreaders. Diplomacy (DC 16 Persuasion) reveals it's protecting an ancient demonic seal.                                                           | Single CR 3. Climax hook: Breaking the seal unleashes a minor fiend (CR 4).                            |

> [!NOTE]
> DM Tips
> 
> - Scaling: For lower-level parties, reduce numbers or use minions. For higher levels, add environmental hazards like fog (heavily obscured) or brine quagmires (difficult terrain, DC 12 Dexterity save or prone).
> - Themes: Tie encounters to Brinehaven's lore—demonic influences, smuggling rings, or salt marsh curses—to build toward town-based adventures.
> - Frequency: Roll once per watch or hex traveled. On a natural 20, roll twice and combine (e.g., wolves with a smuggler's camp).
> - Treasure Adjustment: Use the DMG's encounter loot guidelines (p. 133) for balance.
