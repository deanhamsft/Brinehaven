[[North from Brinehaven]]
Random Encounter Table: 

The salt marshes north of Brinehaven are a treacherous expanse of brackish pools, sucking mud, and fog-choked reeds, where the line between land and sea blurs. These wetlands, tainted by ancient curses are home to warped creatures, and lingering demonic influences.

> [!NOTE]
> DM Tips
> 
> - Scaling: For lower-level parties, reduce enemy numbers or use weaker variants (e.g., replace chuul with giant crab). For higher levels, add environmental hazards like quicksand (DC 14 Strength to escape) or increase CR (e.g., adult dragon for roll 20).
> - Thematic Ties: Emphasize Brinehaven’s demonic undercurrents, smuggling networks, and cursed history. Encounters like the cursed altar or marsh wyrm can tie into larger campaign arcs involving fiends or ancient pacts.
> - Environment: The marshes are difficult terrain (half movement). Fog often reduces visibility (lightly obscured, -2 to Perception). Standing water may hide hazards (DC 12 Perception to spot).
> - Frequency: Roll once per hour of travel or per hex in a hex crawl. On a natural 20, combine with another roll (e.g., a wyrm guarding a sunken wreck).
> - Treasure: Use Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG, p. 133) for balanced loot. Marsh encounters favor water-themed items or cursed relics tied to Brinehaven’s lore.
