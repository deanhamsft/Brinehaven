Carival Stanislain, the Cloaked Stranger
[[Retch]]
Background

- Full Name: Carival Stanislain
- Race: Human
- Age: 39
- Class: Sorcerer (Level 5)
- Alignment: Chaotic Evil
- History: Carival hails from a minor noble family in a northern port city, where his latent sorcerous power—fueled by a draconic bloodline (likely blue dragon ancestry)—manifested during a shipwreck that killed his family. Surviving through cunning, he turned to manipulation, amassing wealth through blackmail and artifact trafficking. His greed led him to hear tales of the Auror’s Bounty’s cursed pearl, a relic he believes can amplify his magic. Too cowardly to dive into the wreck himself, he manipulates others—smugglers, sahuagin, and now the party—to retrieve it. He occupies a remote tower far north of Brinehaven but has recently been operating in the area, meeting Retch and Kael Draven to orchestrate the treasure hunt. His ultimate master is Lord Valthor Krenn, a shadowy archmage in a fortress three weeks’ travel northwest, who seeks the pearl for a ritual to dominate the northern seas.

Personality

- Traits: Greedy, silver-tongued, and paranoid. Carival exudes charm to mask his cowardice, using flattery or threats to bend others to his will. His draconic pride makes him despise failure.
- Ideal: Power through wealth—Carival believes the pearl will elevate him above Valthor and secure his independence.
- Bond: A cracked sapphire pendant, a memento of his lost family, which he clutches when nervous.
- Flaw: His cowardice drives him to flee at the first sign of real danger, abandoning allies or plans.

Hideout: The Northern Tower

- Location: 50 miles north of Brinehaven, a three-day journey by horse or boat, perched on a cliff overlooking a desolate bay.
- Description: A 60-ft-tall stone tower, weathered by sea spray, with a single entrance guarded by a Glyph of Warding (DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) to detect, 5d8 thunder damage, DC 15 Dexterity save). The interior includes:
    - Ground Floor: A study with arcane tomes (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) for a Spell Scroll of Invisibility) and a scrying pool (shows Brinehaven if activated, DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)).
    - Upper Chamber: Carival’s lair, with a bed, chest (DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools), 200 gp, Pearl of Power), and a balcony for spellcasting.
    - Defenses: 2 animated armor (CR 1) guard the tower, activated by intruders.
- Current Status: Carival is absent, having traveled to Brinehaven to oversee the pearl’s retrieval, but he plans to return by Friday, October 10, 2025.

Campaign Ties

- The Auror’s Bounty: Carival learned of the pearl’s power from Valthor’s agents, believing it can enhance his sorcery. He gave the party the initial map fragment via Retch, manipulating them to face the wreck’s dangers while he reaps the reward.
- Smugglers: He brokers with Kael Draven, promising gold for the pearl. Retch’s journal and letter confirm his meetings, suggesting a deal to trade the relic to Valthor.
- Sahuagin: Carival allied with the sahuagin priestess, offering tribute (smuggled goods) to secure their aid against the party, explaining their attacks.
- Rune Connection & Hearthstone’s Secret: He seeks to disrupt the elven ward (via the markers and hearthstone) to weaken the pearl’s guardian, using the ritual’s energy to claim it. His presence near Stormwatch Point (meeting Retch) hints at this plan.
- Lord Valthor Krenn: A 12th-level wizard and sea cult leader, Valthor resides in a fortress 600 miles northwest (three weeks’ travel by foot, two by horse). He demands the pearl for a ritual to summon a kraken, viewing Carival as a disposable pawn.

Interaction with the Party

- Encounter: The party may meet Carival at Blackreef Cove tonight (6 PM MDT, October 08, 2025) during the storm, where he oversees the smugglers’ dive. He’s disguised (DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) to penetrate), posing as a merchant.
- Dialogue Options:
    - Intimidation (DC 16 Charisma): Threaten to expose him to Valthor. Success yields the scroll and tower location; failure triggers Fireball.
    - Persuasion (DC 14 Charisma): Offer a share of the pearl’s power. Success gains his temporary alliance; failure makes him hostile.
    - Deception (DC 15 Charisma): Pretend to serve Valthor. Success unlocks the scrying pool’s use; failure alerts his guards.
- Combat: Carival uses Misty Step to flee after casting Haste on himself or Fireball (8d6 fire, DC 14 Dexterity save). His 32 HP and mobility suit a Level 4-6 party, but he surrenders if reduced to 10 HP.
- Reward: Defeating or turning him yields the scroll (reveals Valthor’s fortress), 150 gp, and a lead to the tower.

> DM Notes
> 
> - Level Range: Carival (CR 3) suits a Level 4-6 party of six. Add smugglers or elementals for Level 5+, or reduce spells for Level 3.
> - Pacing: The storm deadline (6 PM MDT) and Carival’s return (Friday) create urgency. The fortress trip extends the campaign arc.
> - Scaling: For Level 3, limit him to 3rd-level spells. For Level 7+, include Valthor’s proxy (e.g., a Mage, CR 6) with Carival.
> - Tie-Ins: His cowardice and greed drive the plot, linking the wreck, smugglers, sahuagin, and Valthor’s cult. The pearl’s curse ties to the hearthstone ward.
