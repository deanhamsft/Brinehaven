**With the sun high but veiled by a thin layer of coastal clouds, casting a soft light over the stony shore.**

**The village of Brinehaven buzzes quietly as a small, weathered sloop named The Gull’s Cry docks at the village’s modest pier, a creaking structure of barnacle-encrusted stone and wood jutting into the churning sea. The air smells of salt and pine, and gulls wheel overhead, their cries mingling with the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky coast. The village’s stone-and-timber homes huddle around a central square, where the Brinehaven Hearth stands as the warm, inviting heart of the community. A faint haze of woodsmoke curls from the tavern’s chimney, and the distant sound of a hammer on anvil echoes from a nearby smithy.The six adventurers—strangers to one another until their shared journey aboard The Gull’s Cry—step onto the pier, their boots clacking on the weathered boardwalk. Each carries their own reasons for chasing the cryptic promise of a treasure map fragment, offered by a shadowy figure they met in a distant city. The man, described only as “cloaked, with a voice like gravel and a glint in his eye,” he spoke of a legendary shipwreck: 'The Auror’s Bounty', an imperial galleon said to have sunk 300 years ago off Brinehaven’s treacherous coast, its hold brimming with gold coins, jeweled relics, and perhaps something more arcane. The fragment he provided—parchment yellowed with age, etched with a partial map and the words “Brinehaven’s stones guard the way”—pointed them here, to this remote village far from the empire’s reach.**

**As the adventurers make their way toward the Brinehaven Hearth, drawn by the promise of food, rest, and answers, the village watches with cautious curiosity. Fishermen mending nets pause to glance at the newcomers, while a half-elf child darts into an alley, whispering of “strangers with swords.” The party’s arrival is about to stir the sleepy village, and the tavern will be their first step into the mystery of** "**The Auror’s Bounty.**"
